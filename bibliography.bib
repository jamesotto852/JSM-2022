 abstract = {Many statistical methods involve summarizing a probability distribution by a region of the sample space covering a specified probability. One method of selecting such a region is to require it to contain points of relatively high density. Highest density regions are particularly useful for displaying multimodal distributions and, in such cases, may consist of several disjoint subsets-one for each local mode. In this paper, I propose a simple method for computing a highest density region from any given (possibly multivariate) density f(x) that is bounded and continuous in x. Several examples of the use of highest density regions in statistical graphics are also given. A new form of boxplot is proposed based on highest density regions; versions in one and two dimensions are given. Highest density regions in higher dimensions are also discussed and plotted.},

 abstract = {An analysis of data on the duration times and waiting times for eruptions from the Old Faithful Geyser reveals an interesting time series structure. A tentative physical model, derived from Rinehart, is outlined and a corresponding first-order Markov chain examined. It is shown that a second-order models is necessary to explain the observed correlations in the data. A curious clustering effect is apparent in the autocorrelation function when plotted over a large range of lags. Similar patterns are observed in simulations from the fitted second-order model.},
